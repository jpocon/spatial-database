        "# **Assignment 2: Database Normalization using PostgreSQL with PostGIS Extension**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective:\n",
        "This assignment will guide you through the process of designing and normalizing a relational database to the first and second normal forms (1NF and 2NF) using PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension. You'll learn the concepts of normalization, how to reduce data redundancy, and improve data integrity. The focus will be on creating spatial tables that adhere to these normalization rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment will solidify your understanding of database normalization principles, specifically focusing on the first two normal forms, and introduce you to working with spatial data in PostgreSQL using the PostGIS extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Tools Required:\n",
        "- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension\n",
        "- pgAdmin or any PostgreSQL client\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Background on Normal Forms**:\n",
        "- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Requires that all table values are atomic (indivisible) and each column contains unique values. Essentially, no repeating groups or arrays are allowed within any single row, and each column must contain values of a single type.\n",
        "- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Achieved when it is in the first normal form and all non-key attributes are fully functional and dependent on the primary key. It eliminates partial dependency.\n",
        "- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.\n",
        "- **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**: A table is in 4NF if it is in 3NF and does not have any multi-valued dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Primary vs. Foreign Keys**\n",
        "Understanding primary and foreign keys is crucial for database integrity and functionality, enabling the efficient organization, retrieval, and management of relational data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Primary Key\n",
        "\n",
        "A **primary key** is a column (or a set of columns) in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. The primary key has two main purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Uniqueness:** It ensures that no two rows have the same primary key value, guaranteeing the uniqueness of each record. This is crucial for accurately identifying and referencing specific data entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Indexing:** The primary key automatically creates an index in the table, which speeds up data retrieval operations. An index allows the database system to find and access data efficiently without scanning the entire table.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Characteristics of a Primary Key:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Uniqueness:** Each value must be unique across all records in the table.\n",
        "- **Not Null:** A primary key cannot have a NULL value, as it must identify a record.\n",
        "- **Stability:** The value of a primary key should not change. While technically possible, updating primary keys is generally discouraged because they are used to reference rows in other tables.\n",
        "- **Simplicity:** Ideally, a primary key should be compact and consist of as few columns as necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a table `Users` with columns `UserID`, `Username`, and `Email`. The `UserID` could serve as the primary key because each user has a unique ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Foreign Key\n",
        "\n",
        "A **foreign key** is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table or the same table (in case of self-referencing). The foreign key establishes a **relationship** between two tables, often to enforce referential integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Purpose of a Foreign Key:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Referential Integrity:** It ensures that the relationship between two tables remains consistent. For example, if table A references table B, a foreign key in table A prevents you from adding a record that does not have a corresponding value in table B.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Relationship Establishment:** Foreign keys define how tables relate to each other, allowing for complex queries that span multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Characteristics of a Foreign Key:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reference:** It references the primary key or a unique key in another table.\n",
        "- **Nullable:** A foreign key can be NULL, indicating that a relationship may not exist for some rows.\n",
        "- **Multiplicity:** A single foreign key value can reference multiple rows in the related table, supporting one-to-many relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuing with the `Users` table example, suppose there's another table `Orders` with columns `OrderID`, `OrderDate`, and `UserID`. The `UserID` in `Orders` is a foreign key that references `UserID` in the `Users` table. This setup ensures that every order is linked to a user who placed it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Primary vs. Foreign Key - Key Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Purpose:** Primary keys uniquely identify records within a table. Foreign keys link records between tables.\n",
        "- **Uniqueness:** Primary key values must be unique within its table. Foreign key values do not need to be unique and often repeat in the referencing table.\n",
        "- **Nullability:** Primary keys cannot be NULL. Foreign keys can be NULL, depending on the relationship and design requirements.\n",
        "- **Referential Role:** Only foreign keys have a referential role, establishing a direct relationship between tables.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Manually Create a Non-Normalized Table:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Create a table named 'Parks_Info' with three columns: ID, ParkName, and Facilities.\n",
        "  - 'ID' is a serial number that automatically increments with each new row and is the primary key.\n",
        "  - 'ParkName' and 'Facilities' are text fields that can store up to 255 characters.\n",

        "  - 'Central Park' has a playground, restroom, and picnic area.\n",
        "  - 'Liberty Park' has a restroom and picnic area.-- 'Riverside Park' has a playground and bike path.\n",
        "\n",

        "2. **Normalize to 1NF:**\n",
        "  - Break down the `Facilities` column so each facility is in its own row.\n",
        "  - Create a new table 'Parks' to store information about parks with a more normalized structure.\n",
        "  - 'ParkID' is a unique identifier for each park, and 'ParkName' stores the name of the park.\n",

This approach will not only allow us to review your SQL scripts, report, and screenshots but also introduce you to best practices in code versioning and collaboration. Follow the steps below to prepare and submit your assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Prepare Your Submission\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Organize Your Project Folder**:\n",
        "   - Ensure your project folder is well-organized and contains only the files you intend to submit. Typically, this will include:\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Create a .gitignore File** (Optional but Recommended):\n",
        "   - Create a `.gitignore` file to specify files or directories that Git should ignore, such as large data files or personal configuration files. Use the `touch .gitignore` command to create this file, then edit it with a text editor to add your rules.\n",
