# Welcome to Spatial Database Development in Practice

Spatial database development, a key component of GIS project management, focuses on the organization of location-based data. Participants will learn database development best practices, data collection and standardization, and how to apply topological rules to a database. Throughout the course, students will work on final database projects which will build skills required in professional GIS positions, with an emphasis on collaboration and real-world applications of data.

It is recommended that students are required to have introductory knowledge of GIS and spatial data handling.

## Learning Objectives
Student evaluation during this course will depend on understanding and applying fundamental spatial database development and interaction through assignments and class exercises. For a more comprehensive understanding of the course schedule and what is expected of students, please consult the [Syllabus]().

By the end of the course, students will:
- Understand the foundational knowledge behind databases, specifically geodatabases;
- Interact with spatial data using different relationships across databases with SQL;
- Learn standard database management protocols, including data collection, normalization, and version control via [Git](https://github.com/).

## Student Responsibilities
Each student is responsible for the following:
- Completely reading the [Syllabus]() and understanding course requirements;
- Staying informed and up-to-date on all course-related work each and every week;
