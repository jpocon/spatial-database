    "## **Introduction to Database Normalization - 1NF and 2NF**\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Objective*\n",
    "This lecture aims to introduce the concepts of the First Normal Form (1NF) and the Second Normal Form (2NF) in database normalization. By understanding these foundational concepts, students will learn to design databases that reduce redundancy and enhance data integrity.\n",

    "### **Recommendations and Best Practices for Spatial Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing primarily on spatial data involves understanding the unique challenges and considerations that come with managing geospatial information in databases, especially when applying normalization principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed look into how these recommendations apply to spatial data:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Start with a Thorough Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand Spatial Relationships**: Analyze how spatial entities relate to each other. For instance, are there one-to-many relationships between geographic features, like multiple buildings within a single city block? Understanding these spatial relationships is crucial for designing your database schema.\n",
    "  - Initial analysis can take place in QGIS, PostgreSQL (with the PostGIS extension), or through a GIS analytical framework of your choosing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Identify Spatial Dependencies**: Determine if spatial attributes depend on primary keys or if they exhibit partial dependencies. For example, a `Landmarks` table might have a `Location` column that's functionally dependent on the landmark ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consider Spatial Data Types**: Be familiar with spatial data types provided by PostGIS, such as `GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY`, and understand when to use them based on your data's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Use Normalization as Part of Your Database Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Apply Spatial Indexes Wisely**: While normalization is about the logical structure of your database, it's also important to consider physical aspects like indexing.\n",
    "  - Considering which tables and columns will benefit most from them.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Normalization and Spatial Queries**: Consider how normalization will affect your spatial queries. Sometimes, denormalizing spatial data slightly (e.g., duplicating some spatial columns in another table for faster access) can improve query performance for specific, frequently used operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Remember that Over-normalization Can Lead to Excessive Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balancing Normalization and Performance**: Spatial queries can be computationally intensive. Over-normalization can lead to multiple joins between tables, which might degrade performance for complex spatial queries. It is often a good practice to balance between normalization for data integrity and denormalization for query performance, especially in spatial databases where queries might involve calculations over large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Materialized Views for Complex Spatial Data**: When dealing with complex spatial data and queries that span multiple normalized tables, consider using materialized views to store pre-computed joins or spatial operations. This can improve read performance at the cost of additional storage and the need to refresh the view after updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Additional Considerations for Spatial Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Integrity and Spatial Features**: Use constraints and triggers to maintain data integrity, especially for spatial data. For example, triggers can automatically update spatial columns (like calculating the centroid of a polygon) when related non-spatial information changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage Considerations**: Spatial data, especially when dealing with high-resolution geometries or large geographic areas, can be large. Consider the storage implications of your normalization decisions, particularly for how spatial data is stored and retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Practical Example:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a database that stores information about cities and their points of interest (POIs). A simple approach might store everything in a single table, including city names, POI names, and the POIs' geographic locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization would involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a separate `Cities` table with city names and identifiers.\n",
    "2. Creating a `POIs` table with references to the `Cities` table, POI names, and spatial data representing their locations.\n",
    "3. Ensuring that spatial queries are optimized by applying spatial indexes on the `POIs` table's location column.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure reduces redundancy (e.g., city names repeated for each POI) and improves data integrity while allowing efficient spatial queries, such as finding all POIs within a specific city.\n",

    "### **Exercise 1: Normalize to First Normal Form (1NF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Scenario*\n",
    "You're given a table `CustomerOrders` that tracks customer orders for products. However, the table violates the First Normal Form (1NF) because it contains repeating groups in the `ProductIDs` and `Quantities` columns.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Steps and SQL Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Two Separate Tables:**\n",
    "   - One for `Orders` to track each order.\n",
    "   - Another for `OrderDetails` to track each product within an order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Create the `Orders` Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Orders (\n",
    "    OrderID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    CustomerName VARCHAR(255)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Create the `OrderDetails` Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (\n",
    "    DetailID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    OrderID INT,\n",
    "    ProductID INT,\n",
    "    Quantity INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Orders(OrderID)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insert Data Into the `Orders` Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerName) VALUES\n",
    "(1, 'John Doe'),\n",
    "(2, 'Jane Smith'),\n",
    "(3, 'Mike Brown');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insert Data Into the `OrderDetails` Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, you'll manually split the `ProductIDs` and `Quantities` into separate rows. In a real-world scenario, this might require a script or manual data manipulation based on the original data format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO OrderDetails (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity) VALUES\n",
    "(1, 101, 2),\n",
    "(1, 102, 1),\n",
    "(2, 103, 3),\n",
    "(3, 101, 1),\n",
    "(3, 104, 2),\n",
    "(3, 105, 1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result:\n",
    "Now, the data is in 1NF. Each row in `OrderDetails` represents a single product order, eliminating the repeating groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 2: Normalize to Second Normal Form (2NF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Scenario*\n",
    "The `OrderDetails` table from Exercise 1 is in 1NF but not in 2NF because the `Quantity` field is only dependent on `ProductID`, not on the composite key (`OrderID`, `ProductID`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Objective*\n",
    "Normalize the data structure to 2NF by ensuring all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps and SQL Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Partial Dependencies:**\n",
    "   The partial dependency is that `Quantity` depends on `ProductID` but not on the composite key. However, this scenario might be a misunderstanding of 2NF principles, as `Quantity` actually depends on both `OrderID` and `ProductID` (how many of a product were ordered in each specific order). A more accurate example of partial dependency would involve product information like `ProductName` or `ProductPrice` depending on `ProductID` alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Separate Table for Products:**\n",
    "   Assuming a more fitting scenario for 2NF, where `ProductPrice` depends only on `ProductID`, not on the composite key of an order detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Products (\n",
    "    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    ProductName VARCHAR(255),\n",
    "    ProductPrice DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remove the Partial Dependency from `OrderDetails`:**\n",
    "   - Adjust `OrderDetails` to reference `Products`.\n",
    "   - Assume `OrderDetails` already exists without `ProductPrice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Populate the `Products` Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, ProductPrice) VALUES\n",
    "(101, 'Product A', 10.00),\n",
    "(102, 'Product B', 15.50),\n",
    "(103, 'Product C', 7.25),\n",
    "(104, 'Product D', 12.00),\n",
    "(105, 'Product E', 5.75);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Adjust `OrderDetails` (if needed)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OrderDetails` table should reference `Products` without storing product-specific information like price, which eliminates the partial dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Assuming we need to adjust the schema (if it previously included ProductPrice, for instance\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE OrderDetails DROP COLUMN ProductPrice; -- Only if ProductPrice was previously included.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result:\n",
    "By ensuring that all attributes in `OrderDetails` are fully functionally dependent on the primary key and by separating product-specific information into its own table, the database schema is now in 2NF. Each non-key attribute in `OrderDetails` is fully functionally dependent on the primary key (`DetailID`), and product information is correctly normalized into the `Products` table.\n"
