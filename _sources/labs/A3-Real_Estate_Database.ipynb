        "# **Assignment 3 - Normalizing Spatial Data in a Real Estate Database**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "You will design and normalize a simplistic database for a real estate platform that stores property details, including spatial data. The assignment will take you through creating an initial table structure and progressively normalizing it to the Third Normal Form (3NF) and Fourth Normal Form (4NF). Additionally, you will use PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension for handling spatial data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Part 1: Initial Setup**\n",
        "1. Ensure PostgreSQL and PostGIS are installed and properly configured on your system.\n",
        "2. Create a new database named `RealEstateDB`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   CREATE DATABASE \"RealEstateDB\"; -- Use double quotations to preserve case sensitivity.\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "3. Connect to your database and enable the PostGIS extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   -- Connect to RealEstateDB\n",
        "   \\c RealEstateDB\n",
        "   \n",
        "   -- If you defined your database without double quotation marks, then to connect, you'll type in the name in all lowercase (specific to PostgreSQL)\n",
        "   \\c realestatedb\n",
        "   \n",
        "   -- Enable PostGIS\n",
        "   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Part 2: Creating the Initial Table**\n",
        "Create an initial `PropertyDetails` table that intentionally violates normalization principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE PropertyDetails (\n",
        "    PropertyID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    Address VARCHAR(255),\n",
        "    City VARCHAR(100),\n",
        "    State VARCHAR(50),\n",

        "    GeoLocation GEOMETRY(Point, 4326), -- Spatial data type\n",
        "    CityPopulation INT\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "This table is in **First Normal Form (1NF)** because:\n",
        "- Each column holds atomic, indivisible values.\n",
        "- Rows are uniquely identifiable by `PropertyID`.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's also in **Second Normal Form (2NF)** by default since:\n",
        "- It's already in 1NF.\n",
        "- It does not have a composite primary key, making partial dependency concerns non-applicable.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Part 3: Normalize to 3NF**\n",
        "To achieve 3NF, remove transitive dependencies. This involves creating a new table for city demographics and adjusting the `PropertyDetails` table accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create `CityDemographics` Table**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",

        "   );\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Modify `PropertyDetails` Table**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   ALTER TABLE PropertyDetails DROP COLUMN CityPopulation, DROP COLUMN State, DROP COLUMN Country;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - All attributes in `PropertyDetails` are now directly dependent on the primary key.\n",
        "   - `CityDemographics` handles the transitive dependency of `CityPopulation`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Part 4: Normalize to 4NF**\n",
        "Address multi-valued dependencies by creating separate tables for `ZoningType` and `Utility`.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create `PropertyZoning` and `PropertyUtilities` Tables**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   CREATE TABLE PropertyZoning (\n",

        "   );\n",
        "   ```\n",

        "2. **Remove Columns from `PropertyDetails`**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   ALTER TABLE PropertyDetails DROP COLUMN ZoningType, DROP COLUMN Utility;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - By separating `ZoningType` and `Utility` into their tables, we eliminate multi-valued dependencies in `PropertyDetails`.\n",

        "Inserting and querying spatial data using PostGIS.\n",

The repository is organized with clear instructions and a good report. Minor issues in documentation or organization. | The report addresses normalization principles but with limited examples and superficial explanations. The repository and documentation lack some organization, making review challenging. | The report is incomplete, lacks clarity, or misses significant portions of normalization principles. Poorly managed repository with inadequate documentation and report. Collaborators are not properly invited or cannot access materials easily. |\n",

        "#### Additional Notes for Students:\n",
        "- Ensure SQL scripts are executable without errors and clearly formatted. Comments within the scripts should explain their purpose and how they apply to normalization principles.\n",
        "- The Markdown report should detail the journey from 1NF through to 4NF, providing specific examples from your SQL scripts and explaining why each step satisfies the corresponding normalization form.\n",
        "- Pay special attention to the clarity of your explanations in the Markdown report. The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of database normalization and spatial data management through detailed examples and explanations.\n",
        "- Include a section in your README.md on how to set up PostGIS and prerequisites for running your SQL scripts, alongside the Markdown report for normalization explanation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Submission Instructions**\n",
        "1. Push all SQL scripts and your Markdown report detailing the normalization process to your designated GitHub repository.\n",
        "2. Ensure your README.md includes setup instructions and a brief overview of the repository contents.\n",
        "3. Invite your instructor and course assistant to your repository as collaborators using their provided GitHub usernames.\n",
        "4. Submit the link to your GitHub repository on [Canvas](https://canvas.clarku.edu/courses/11669/assignments/83770) before the deadline.\n"
